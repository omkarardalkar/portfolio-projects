# Valentine's Day Interactive App ðŸ’•

## Description
A playful React application that asks the user to be someone's Valentine, with a fun, interactive twist where the "No" button becomes increasingly difficult to click.

## Features
- Responsive design with centered layout
- Dynamic button sizing
- Progressive "No" button text that becomes more emotional
- Cute animated GIFs
- Simple, engaging user interaction

## Technologies Used
- React
- TypeScript
- CSS

## How It Works
When the user is asked "Will you be my valentine?", they have two button options:
- **Yes Button**: Gets larger with each "No" click
- **No Button**: Changes text and becomes harder to click
  - Displays progressively emotional messages like "No", "Are you sure?", "Pookie pleasee!", etc.
